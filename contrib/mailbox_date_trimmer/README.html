<h1><a name="scenario-description">Scenario description</a></h1>
<p>You are a mailing list administrator, or you are somebody who keeps
mailing list archives for a user group, or you just have a fetish
for email archives. Now, don't you always wonder why after running
<a class="reference" href="http://www.hypermail.org/">Hypermail</a> or <a class="reference" href="http://www.mhonarc.org/">MHonArc</a> on your archives you always have some emails
which date back to 1980 or far away in the future like 2011, even
though you started collecting emails in the year 2000 and it's still
this very same year?  While there are many answers to this question,
there is a very easy way to fix many, if not all, of these messages,
which results in a much more consistent email archive without broken
discussion threads.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work">
<h1><a name="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h1>
<p>Mailing lists with some activity register at least some messages
every month, and luckily most of these emails have correct
dates. This program iterates through the email archive of your
choice (in Unix mailbox format) checking the date header of each
email and comparing it to the date of the previous email. If the
difference in time is greater than a month, the current email's
date is considered invalid.</p>
<p>When an email is sent to a mailing list, it is very likely that it
<em>hops</em> through some computers before it reaches its audience. The
good thing about this is that each <em>hop</em> adds to the email's
headers a timestamp. People running email servers connected day
and night to the internet usually set them up correctly (or face
the consequences), so it is very unlikely that one of these added
timestamps is incorrect.  Also, email delivery tends to be pretty
quick from one of these servers to another, with delays not bigger
than minutes or even seconds in most circunstances.</p>
<p>So when the current email's date is considered invalid,
mailbox_date_trimmer finds all the date timestamps in the headers,
and reading them in reverse order (servers add their headers to
the beginning of the email) picks the first one whose difference
to the previous email is smaller than one month (usually the first
choice 99% of the time).</p>
<p>In the broken cases where an email doesn't have ANY header at all,
mailbox_date_trimmer adds to this email the time of the previos
email plus one second. In the cases where the closest match doesn't
fall in the expected one month timeframe, mailbox_date_trimmer gives
up and doesn't add any header at all. The latter could happen with
legitimate emails which you moved incorrectly to a folder, or you
unsubscribed for holidays and resubscribed much later, etc.</p>
<p>If your mailbox contains messages which fall into this category,
tough luck, you will have to weed them out manually.  For most of
the other people in the world, rejoice, your calvary has come to
an end, you can finally enjoy email archives with consistent dates.</p>

<h1><a name="software-requisites">Software requisites</a></h1>
<p>This software requires Python (<a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a>). It is known
to work with versions 1.5.2 or 2.2.3. You also need my mailbox_reader
module, which you should be able to get from:</p>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="usage">
<h1><a name="usage">Usage</a></h1>
<p>mailbox_date_trimmer is a commandline tool with pretty few options.
Running mailbox_date_trimmer with the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-h</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt> arguments
should bring up a help screen showing you how to use the program
and with what switches.  This program can read mailboxes from the
hard disk or through standard input. It can also write new mailboxes
or dump everything through standard output. The former means that
if you run the program without arguments it will sit there idle
waiting for your input, just like the grep command.</p>
<p>You can run the program like a filter inside a more complex command
chain.  It consumes/produces data one email at a time, so you can
feed it gigabytes of data and it should not run out of memory unless
you have emails which don't fit in your available free memory,
or you have another heavy weight process consuming all your memory.</p>
<p>Note that while I have run this over all my personal mailing list
archives, and the program is written in such a way that it should
never do stupid things, hey, I'm a stupid human, and the computer
just followed my instructions. So better make a safe backup of
your mail archives before you use this software on them. Anyway,
it has worked correctly with about 500MB of mail archives, which
is all I have been able to get from internet and friends.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="checking-the-generated-output">
<h1><a name="checking-the-generated-output">Checking the generated output</a></h1>
<p>In order to verify that mailbox_date_trimmer didn't break anything
seriously, the first thing you should do is inspect the generated
mail archive and count the number of emails, it should equal the
number of emails in your original mailbox. If this is not the case,
I'm sorry, I must have done something terrible. Drop me an email.</p>
<p>The second thing you can do is go one email after another checking
what dates were modified. When mailbox_date_trimmer modifies the
date of an email, if the verbose switch has been used, the original
date is stored in the header <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">X-DT</span></tt>. The reason of the change
is stored in the header <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">X-pi</span></tt>. You can therefore extract all
modified messages with the following command, if you have grepmail
available on your machine:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
grepmail -h X-pi mailbox &gt; changed
</pre>
<p>Now you can open this new mailbox and see easier which messages
where modified. Don't you like these extra headers? Well, currently
you have to grep them out yourself.</p>
<p>You will notice that most of the dates the program generates are
not accurate. I didn't bother to parse timezones, an error of some
hours is irrelevant when the acceptation time frame is one month
in both directions.  Also, time operations are done using the local
time of your machine, should be using UTC.</p>
<p>However, little differences in time didn't cause me any problems
at all. You are welcome to send me patches in unified diff format
to improve this or any other aspect of the program. The current
version satisfied all my neccesities, so it is quite unlikely that
I will actively improve this software (no itch to scratch).</p>

<div class="section" id="contact-information">
<h1><a name="contact-information">Contact information</a></h1>
<p>You should be able to get me through <a class="reference" href="mailto:gradha&#64;users.sourceforge.net">gradha&#64;users.sourceforge.net</a>. If
this fails, try going to my web page (currently at
<a class="reference" href="http://gradha.sdf-eu.org/">http://gradha.sdf-eu.org/</a>), my current email address is stamped at
the bottom of most pages. If that URL fails, you could try Googling
by &quot;Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz&quot; (don't forget the quotes). Am I
narcissistic or what? As if you ever wanted to know that much...</p>
