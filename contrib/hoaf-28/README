Subject: XML indexer, experimental, patch+python script

Hello hypermailers,

I know I shouldn't have done this, 
but I learned about python's XML handling in the process. 
This is my first attempt in XML file mangeling, so bear with me.


I was always talking and thinking about how to get montly archives done
and not only done, but the index files created, too:

		The problem:
		------------

Hypermail in combination with the archive scripts, creates
a bunch of directories for each year and each month when mails come in.

	a) How do you make a top page, 
	linking all the scattered index files?

	b) Subproblem: If one mail comes in, 
	do you really want to rebuild the complete index overviewfiles?
	Of course not.

	c) What if I want my top index page to have the number of mails 
	grouped by week or so. :) (Hi egroups.)


Solution: A python script strangles the problem.

Part 1: I patched hypermail so that it creates an archive overview file 
	complying with the haof.dtd in each directory it operates in.

Oh, back to Part 0:
	Wrote a dtd for the Hypermail Archive Overview Format (hoaf).

Part 2a: Wrote a little python module, which creates a HTML snipplet from this
	overviewfile and leaves it in the directory above. But only,
	if the overviewfile exists and is newer as the the snipplet.

Part 2b: Wrote another python script, which runs through a directory,
	and checks each year and month and runs the module from 2a a
	couple of times.

Results attached. 

Left for the interested reader: Beautify the output.

Interesting research topics: 
* Only the mail references are missing in the 
  hoaf, otherwise threading could be done on that level.
* Well we could write this data into a little database. http://www.dbxml.org/ ?
 Or Postgres or MySql-GPL?

Enjoy,
	Bernhard

I contribute it to hypermail as free software.  My hopes are that hypermail 
stays under GPL, but I think I don't want to complicate things of you choose 
another free software license, so you have permission to publish it under 
this, too.

Message-ID: <19991207005332.A1465@climate2.geog.uwm.edu>

New Version of my nasty python script to create new archive
overview files.  Includes a hypermail to write a xml format file
with the overview information.

I run it from procmail, like:

COLLECT_SNIPPLETS_SCRIPT=/usr/local/lib/site-python/collect_snipplets.py

:0:.polis
*X-Mailing-List: <polis@(genba\.a2e\.de|ffii\.org)>
| polis-mail ; $COLLECT_SNIPPLETS_SCRIPT /var/www/mail-archive/polis

polis-mail is the hypermail wrapper from archive/.
