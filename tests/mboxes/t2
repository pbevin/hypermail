Ouch! I hope you can recover from this. I didn't realize. Sorry.

Yes, Yes! I need this functionality too. I prefer not to add messages
one at a time through the day as Hypermail would go re-indexing over and
over again, so I let my mail collect till the end of the month, and run
hypermail once nightly. Since there's no append function, Hypermail has
to churn through all that month's mail each night. If I could append, I
could erase the mailbox each night and only process that day's mail.

MHonArc has this feature, but I believe it keeps a small database to
remember what's been done before. Perhaps such info could be hidden in
the indexes as HTML comments??
