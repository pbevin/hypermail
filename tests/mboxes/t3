With a slight modification (removal of the -x switch, since this is to
append, not replace), here is one of my batch files. Change paths and
parameters to match your environment.

/home/gordon/bin/hypermail \
-b "http://cusidnet.anadas.com/" \
-a "http://cusidnet.anadas.com/" \
-m "/home/gordon/mail/cusid" \
-l "CUSIDnet Web Mirror" \
-d "/home/gordon/www/cusidnet/fall1998/" \
-c "/home/gordon/bin/.cusidnethyprc" > /dev/null

Note 1: /home/gordon/mail/cusid is a standard UNIX mail folder.
Note 2: /home/gordon/www/cusidnet/fall1998 contains an existing hypermail
archive.
