Kent,

Hmm.  That's odd.  It happens consistently on my system; everytime there
is a mailbox with only one message in it.  It must be some combination
of the defaults that I set when I compiled the code (I changed some of 
the suggested settings), and the settings in the .hmrc file I am calling.

I'll send you my compile time settings and .hmrc file later, and see if 
you can find something in there that is causing it to happen.  (I have 
been up and working on a system problem for thirty-some hours, I need 
to go home, shower, and get in bed -- so it may be tomorrow).

It does dump core on me to, BTW.  Is there a core analysis tool I 
could used that would give you some helpful information?


P.S.  One other thought occured to me.  I was wondering if it might be 
related to the parsing problem I wrote about earlier (which you have 
fixed in the next release -- thank you).  Perhaps it is expecting a 
trailing line with white space on it, or something?  The trouble with 
this idea is that the single message problem was also present in 
version 1.02, and came along to version 2.x.  However, the parsing 
problem wasn't present in version 1.02...
