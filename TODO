This is a file of things to do. If you have other ideas or needs send
them to hypermail-dev@hypermail.org.

===============
General Things:
===============

- Need to use splint to clean up the code.

- Need to clean up the code and remove old code that is commented/ifdefed out.

- Update the doc files to assure all configuration file directives
  are included appropriately in the documentation. Currently the
  documentation does not completely list all options.

- Update the pcre library to a much more recent version.

- Modify configure to locate the appropriate htdocs directory locations
  for installing the documentation and image files.

- Add the msgid hash to the emailinfo structure to speed-up looking
  of this value when we already know it.

- Finish the libtool work on the fnv library so that we can link to
  shared libraries _and_ install/uninstall them.

- Need to lowercase HTML tags to support XHTML 1.0 in the future.

- Need to add XHTML support - Configurable ?

- Make the "New List Message" and "Reply To List" features available
  when usetable == 0

- system() should be replaced by fork()+execvp() (or maybe by s_popen())
  in archive/ mbox2hypermail.c

- HTML code should be escaped where appropriate.

- Make it possible to insert the FONT to use in the tables.
  <TH><FONT ...>string</FONT></TH>
  Fonts are not be inherited correctly in many browsers.

- Have configure look at the language selected and if it is not "en" 
  set the EURODATE to 1.

- Add date/subject/author filters for articles that are read in

- Need to create a library of hypermail functions so that other utilities
  can be generated without making things real ugly. (i.e. removal, other
  indexing.)

- Combine mbox2hypermail.c and msg2archive.c into a single program instead
  of having the two do the same general job...

- There is an irreversible aspect to piping messages into hypermail;
  what gets written into HTML does not readily convert back to RFC822
  form such that it could be re-archived (put in another archive, etc.)

- Convert the doc files to a SGML system like linuxdoc, which will allow
  generating html, text, and man pages from the same source.

 - You currently look for text in messages of the form http://... and
 turn them into hyperlinks. You also look for text in the form
 foo@bar.com and turn that into a mailto: hyperlink.
 I suggest you also look for text in for form of
 mailto:foo@bar.com?subject=bat and turn the whole of it into a
 mailto: link, with the correct subject line.

=============
Index Issues:
=============

- Make the formating of index pages use magic cookies for all parts of the
  page.

- It seems strange and undesireable to have the message date shown only in 
  the subject and author indexes.  It seems *really* strange to not have it 
  show up in the date index!  I wanted it "on" for our archives, and did 
  that in my latest beta, which required changing the "reply" structure to 
  include it (for the thread index).  I think ideally it would be configureable
  on or off.  

- Make it optional that a site generate index files with the listings
  sorted by date in one file and reverse sorted in the other index. 
  This pertains to all index types as well. For example:
     one thread-index with the newest mails topmost
     one thread-index with the oldest mails topmost
     one author-index in alphabetical order
     one author-index in reversed alphabetical or
     etc.

============
Attachments:
============

o Make it configurable to get test/plain attachments to have a link 
  created for them, instead of having them printed out beneath the 
  original email.

o If a filename is not known and the MIME type is known, the proper 
  extension should be added to the randomly generated file name.

o For security reasons, *all* binary attachments should be 
  written to disk with file permissions of 444 or equivalent 
  read-only access and should *never* allowed to be executable.

o The user should be able to 1 indicate if attachments are stored to
  be stored as separate files from the original message. 
  (Turn it on or off.)

o Specifying a list with 'preferred' content-types when 
  receiving/decoding mixed/alternative attachments. Support is there 
  in the config file but not in the code. Currently the "text" is always 
  preferred.

o It is doubtful that hypermail deals with all kinds of uuencoded 
  attachments as defined with 'x-uue' in the current hypermail. Other 
  MIME resources mention a whole set of different names for this kind 
  of encoding, but are they in use?

o Hypermail should be able to deal with Sun's (silly) mailtool 
  attachments in a manner similar to how it deals with mime attachments. 
  It would be really cool if the output would be identical and the 
  differences hidden from the user(s).

=================
Configure issues
=================

Defines not used in config.h.in:
HAVE_STRFTIME, HAVE_GETOPT, HAVE_GETPWUID, HAVE_LSTAT,
HAVE_MKDIR, HAVE_STRCASECMP, HAVE_STRDUP, HAVE_STRSTR, HAVE_STRTOL,
HAVE_ALLOCA_H, HAVE_ARPA_INET_H, HAVE_MALLOC_H, HAVE_NDIR_H ,
HAVE_NETDB_H, HAVE_NETINET_IN_H, HAVE_STDARG_H, HAVE_STDIO_H,
HAVE_SYS_DIR_H, HAVE_SYS_NDIR_H , HAVE_SYS_SOCKET_H, HAVE_TIME_H

HAVE_BCOPY is only used in in pcre and not hypermail sources.

Configure needs to support SunOS4x.

Change prototype definitions for certain systems (FREBSD 4.6 for example)

============
Misc. Needs:
============

- EURODATE
  Given that these two formats are ambiguous, and many companies have
  people of both sorts, need an alternate, unambigous date format. 

- Should recognize and parse indented HTML tags better

- Don't ignore umask - HM_UMASK variable? 

- A better icon for hypermail!

- Ability to check for duplicate message IDs using cksum
  to assure that duplicate message are infact truely duplicated
  and not just a different message with the same msg-id header.

- Ability to refer to articles via message ID as well

- The ability to cap the archive to X most recent messages

- Allow for multiple mailbox formats to be recognized, like news articles,
  listproc, elm mailboxes, etc.

- In parsing header fields, check for extra spaces, tabs, etc.

- Check for zero-length headers

- Search for "HTTP" and "http" when making links

- Parse archives with only one or zero messages

- Make sure "sort by..." groups all messages in same thread

- Add sort by "in reply to" as well

=============================
Administrative Things to do:
=============================

o Get a good set of test files.  For now you can use your own...

o Get to develop a complete regression test suite 

===========================
        :Requests:
===========================

* Do you know if there is any way to cutomize the index sort of Hypermail? 
  I am using Solaris mailbox and the header field can be modified by user 
  (i.e. add more headers if required). However, the default index sort of 
  Hypermail only support Author, Thread and Subject. Is there any way to 
  customize the index sort of Hypermail so that we can map the UNIX mail 
  to HTML mail with cutomize headers.

* Would like to see a reindex option. Would like to remove a message from
  the mailbox and click on reindex to delete the message.

* There should be an option I can set in the Hypermail command to cause it 
  to write html files as a specified user.  Right now Hypermail is writing 
  files as daemon and this is causing problems.  We'd prefer that it run as 
  something/someone else.

* One more: I still think that hypermail should also save the
  full mail body part additionally, when there is an OpenPGP(PGP/MIME
  rfc2015) signed Mail. If we do it first, maybe somebody enhances a
  webbrowser to take advantage of it. Would be cool, if it could check
  the signature then.

* It would be nice to be able to throttle hypermail. Could we add a
  config option that would allow hypermail to renice itself ?
