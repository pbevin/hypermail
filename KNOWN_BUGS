This is a list of know problems with the current version of Hypermail

=================================================
Problem: Converting existing hypermail archives 
         to use a different HTML file suffix:

     If you are going to change the filename suffix used from the default 
     ".html" to something else, you must deal with the existing files first. 
     Otherwise, hypermail does not know they are there and starts numbering 
     files from the begining.
 
     This means that you need to either start out fresh, regenerate the 
     archive from an existing mailbox or convert all existing files and 
     the links within the existing archive files to use the proper extension.

=================================================
Problem: File Locking On NFS Mounted Directories:

     File locking doesn't work all that well over NFS. For that reason 
     you are encouraged to run Hypermail on the same system that the 
     disk is on. This is due to possible timing issues within NFS. 
     Hypermail based network locking is not expected to work at this time.

=================================================
Problem: Message Dates:

     Dates on messages prior to 1970 are not processed correctly.

=================================================
Problem: Not parsing correctly.

     The following line is not parsing correctly.

     news:fr.comp.os.ms-windows.win95 post news:34EF975C.4097FF89@club-internet.fr

=================================================
Problem: Embedded HTML 

     If HTML file included in message it is just putting it there 
     without concern of BASE, TITLE, HEAD, BODY ...

=================================================
Problem: Blank name not interpreted correctly.

     Puts out a <STRONG></STRONG> if name is blank.

=================================================
Problem: Memory leaks

     Leaking < 30 bytes per message processed.

=================================================
Problem: Empty container elements

     Putting out empty container elements <P>. Should be <P>&nbsp;</P>

=================================================
Problem: No verification of link syntax

     Not verifying a valid HTML link syntax before converting somthing
     with a http://.

=================================================
Problem: indextable format problem

The message list column widths for "subject" "author" and "date" are sized
based on the content.  Subjects and dates are fairly predictably riddled
with white space on which long lines can wrap.

The "author" string is not -- in particular, I have a person with a long
pseudonym (having a descriptive pseudo-middle name, used to distinguish
between several people with the same first and last name), and a long
machine.domain identifier -- coming out to 52 (!) characters total.  His
MUA does not give a "real name" string that hypermail could use.

In a typical browser display, this forces the 'author' column to about
2/3rds of the display width, and the subject and date get crammed into the
remaining 1/3rd.

The "hm_usetable" resource only affects headers and footers, and not the
bulk of the index display itself.  Is there an existing configuration
choice that could help me?

=================================================
Problem: corrupt mailbox handing.

If the parser never finds the end-boundary in the alternative section it
leaves the parser in an undefined state, it still treats "^From_"
(underscore to display space) lines as the beginning of a new mail. The
problem I think is more related to that the "alternative parser" never really
finishes its work until it finds the end-boundary and when the following
"From " line starts a new mail, something bad happens.  Hypermail should 
process corrupt messages a bit better.

=================================================
Problem: Building on DEC Alpha systems.

Make sure and use the GCC compiler and not the native DEC compiler
when building on a DEC Alpha using TRU64 (OSF1).
