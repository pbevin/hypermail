This directory contains the archive specific information for maintaining 
mailing list archives.  Much of the functionality here has been rendered
obsolete by the folder_by_date option. See ../docs/hmrc.html for more
info about that option.

Also see ../contrib/msg2hypermailarchive.py for another program with
similar functionality. It's author says:
   It can almost do everything that msg2archive could do.
   Together with "formail" it also replaces mailbox2archive for me.
   (e.g. like   cat hypermail-test.9907 | formail -s msg2hypermailarchive.py --month 7 --year 1999 -L hypermail-test -v )


           README - This file.
             1998 - script for recreation of the hypermail archives 
                    from the mailbox version
      Makefile.in - configure Makefile input
    msg2archive.c - Individual message archiver.
 mbox2hypermail.c - Read messages from a mailbox and calls hypermail.

The contents of this directory support automatic generation of hypermail
archives from inbound messages *as well as* the generation of a hypermail
archive from a Unix mailbox of stored messages.

This is how I do it so... Your mileage might vary...

1. First you will need to decide where you want the archive stored at. 

2. Then you will need to edit the file lists.h with the appropriate info.
   Simply add a section such as is shown below. I have a section for each 
   list.  If you are not familiar with 'C' might want to get someone else
   to assist.  Notice that HYPERMAIL is different in the two entries. This
   is because in the case of the wu-ftpd list, it is using a stock hypermail
   executable to save the messages. The nfr-announce list is using a 
   customized version (very useful for testing too.)

    #ifdef WU_FTPD
 
    #define HYPERMAIL    "/usr/local/bin/hypermail" 
    #define ARCHIVE      "/ftp/wu-ftpd/mail-archive" 
    #define MAILBOXDIR   "/ftp/wu-ftpd/mail-archive/mailbox" 
    #define LABEL        "WU-FTPD Development Mailing List"
    #define ABOUT_LINK   "/wu-ftpd" 
    #define LISTNAME     "wu-ftpd"
    #define CONFIGFILE   "NONE"
 
    #else
    #ifdef NFR_ANNOUNCE
 
    #define HYPERMAIL    "/usr/local/bin/nfrhypermail"
    #define ARCHIVE      "/ftp/nfr/mail-archive/nfr-announce"
    #define MAILBOXDIR   "/ftp/nfr/mail-archive/nfr-announce/mailbox"
    #define LABEL        "Network Flight Recorder Announcements"
    #define ABOUT_LINK   "/nfr/mail-archive"
    #define LISTNAME     "nfr-announce"
    #define CONFIGFILE   "/usr/local/lib/hypermail/nfr-announce.rc"

    ...

    If you specify a CONFIGFILE path, it will be used to set hypermail
    options and is call as 

        "HYPERMAIL -u -i -c CONFIGFILE".

    If you do not specify a CONFIGFILE path, hypermail is called using
    the other information as 
    
        "HYPERMAIL -u -i -d ARCHIVE/year/month -l \"LABEL\" -b ABOUT_LINK"

3.  Next make sure that you have a properly compiled version of hypermail
    installed on the system.

4.  Edit the Makefile and add the appropriate entries. For example:

    wuftpdmail: msg2archive.c
        $(CC) -DWU_FTPD -o $@ msg2archive.c

    wu-rdmsg: mbox2hypermail.c
        $(CC) -DWU_FTPD -o $@ mbox2hypermail.c

5.  Compile and install the new programs.

Now everything software-wise is in place.  Time to setup your mailer
to process the inbound messages.  

6.  You need to add an entry to your /etc/aliases file such as

      wuftpd: "|/usr/local/bin/wuftpdmail"

7.  Assure that your mailer is aware of the new alias, i.e. might need
    to type 'newaliases'.

Now you are ready to start receiving messages.  Time to subscribe your
new alias to the list you want to archive.  If you are running the list 
then this is easy.  In some cases you have to play games to get an alias 
subscribed with other than you normal account. What ever the case get
the new alias subscribed.

======================
So what happens now ?
======================

Messages sent to a list and are resent to the members of the list.  
The alias you subscribed is now a member of the list.  Messages are 
sent to the list archive alias.  The "msg2archive" process is started 
for each message and the messages are stored into the location specified 
in the MAILBOXDIR define.  Messages are stored in the directory in a 
"month' file or as specified in the configuration file.  These are Unix 
mailbox formatted files.  Once the message is archived in mailbox format, 
it is also then archived in hypermail format.  The appropriate hypermail 
is called with the inbound message sent to it to add to the hypermail 
archive.

In this manner each article is available to those who want to read 
them online and to those who want to download an entire month's worth 
of traffic to read with their favorite mail Unix reader.

If there is ever a problem with the hypermail archives, be it a new
look and feel wanted or a bug fix that requires regeneration of the 
archive, the mailbox versions will be used as input to the process.  
The script `1998' and the `mbox2hypermail.c' program in this directory 
are being used for testing and archive re-creation.

If you want to change the look and feel of the individual hypermail 
archive pages, that can be done easily by creating the list specific 
header and footer HTML template files as described in the hypermail.1 
and hmrc.4 man pages.

===========================
Integrating with Majordomo:
===========================

If you are running a majordomo list and want to integrate this with 
majordomo then make sure that the ftp mailbox directory is symlinked 
to ~majordomo/Archives/listname directory so that this scheme does 
not break majordomo.  DO NOT HAVE MAJORDOMO DO ANY ARCHIVING. The 
symlink'ed directory is so people will be able to request archives 
and index listing from majordomo as normal.  Now the list archives 
are reachable via the web, ftp or email.
